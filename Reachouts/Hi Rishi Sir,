Hi Rishi Sir,

Hope you're doing well at Adobe! It was always great working under your guidance at Paytm, and I really appreciate everything I learned from you.

I recently found a job opening at Adobe that matches my skills and experience. I'd love to apply and was hoping you could refer me for the role.

Could you please share your email so I can send over my resume and details? Would really appreciate your support!

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Aditya Raghav
