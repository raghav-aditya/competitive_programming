Hi Rishabh,

Thank you for taking the time to respond—I really appreciate it.

I understand that there are no current openings for backend engineers on your team. However, if you happen to know of any relevant opportunities within your network—perhaps at other companies—I'd be grateful if you could connect me with the right people or share their contact details (if appropriate).

Looking forward to staying in touch, and I truly appreciate any guidance or referrals you can share.

Best regards,
Aditya Raghav
