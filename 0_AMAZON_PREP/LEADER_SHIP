How to Answer Amazon Leadership Principle Interview Questions
Amazon bar-raiser interview round evaluates your responses to behavioral questions and gauges if you’re the right fit for the role. The STAR method is a widely popularized method to answer behavioral interview questions at FAANG companies. The method fundamentally aims to frame responses based on real situations and incidents. Let’s look at it in slight detail:

STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.


While answering Amazon leadership principles interview questions, make sure you address each of these areas to craft the perfect response.

Situation: The Situation should answer the “When,” “Why,” and “Where” of the response. When you’re asked a behavioral question, start off with the Situation before moving on to the other elements.
Task: The Task should throw light on what your particular role in the situation was. Highlight what your key responsibilities were and what was expected of you.
Action: The Action part should address what steps you took towards meeting the requirements of the task.
Result: The Result part should essentially answer the outcome of the task. This part should also talk about challenges encountered along the way and the actions taken to tackle them.
Amazon Leadership Principles Interview Questions
Amazon’s behavioral interview will have questions that pertain to one or more leadership principles. While answering these questions, make references to specific principles and associate them with your answers. That way, recruiters will know that you’ve read and understood these crucial principles and are willing to apply them at your workplace.

Amazon Leadership Principles Interview Questions and Answers
Amazon leadership principles interview questions are free-flowing in nature and are mostly driven by your previous work experience. There are no standard questions in this case so you need to understand the leadership principles and use them to structure your answers. These Amazon leadership principles interview questions and answers will help you understand how to answer such behavioral questions.

Q1. Tell us about a time when you overcame a rather difficult challenge pertaining to a past project.

In my previous job, I faced the challenge of delayed delivery that would have jeopardized the completion time of a project. Since this delay might affect deliverables, I took proactive measures by identifying other suppliers and after providing them as workable alternatives to stakeholders coordinated a rapid change of suppliers. This saw us deliver to the originally promised deadline while enhancing the team’s trust in my ability to solve problems.

This question and example answer mirrors the Bias for Action and Deliver Results leadership principles.

Q2. Tell us about a time when you had to halt a project halfway through as it wasn’t headed in the right direction.

In one of my previous roles, while I was working on a marketing campaign, I came to realize that the early metrics were not up to expectations, and the campaign was drifting off course. After reviewing the data, I called for a halt and worked with the team to re-evaluate our strategy. We aligned the campaign back on customer feedback, which brought back double-digit engagement rates.

This particular Amazon leadership principles interview question and answer reflect the Ownership and Customer Obsession principle.

Q3. Tell us about a time when you had to persuade your manager to change the course of action based on credible insights.

While working in my previous role role, I noticed customer feedback trend indicating dissatisfaction due to a user interface. The data collected through further analysis reflected the specific impact on user retention. I presented this data and insights to my manager and proposed the design priority adjustment where usability improvements are taken into account. Although the initial approach was on lines of new features, it was the data-driven insight from my side that convinced them to pivot. This helped to bring down the churn rates by 20%.

Q4. Tell us about an instance when you had to make a tough decision pertaining to a project when you were under pressure.

In one of my prior job roles, last-minute changes in the requirements of a product threatened to postpone our launch. I had to present stakeholders with a choice to extend the deadline or deliver it on time with fewer features set. I chose to release it on schedule with high-quality core features but communicated accordingly with stakeholders.

Q5. Tell us about a time when you had to take a risk in a project.

I was tasked with a project to streamline an existing outdated process. I proposed the automation of several steps, which required an up-front investment of time and resources. This resulted in the effective reduction of 40% of the processing time and a rather good amount of cost savings.
