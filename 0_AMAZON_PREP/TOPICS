PS: Guys if you want to join Amazon, focus on leetcode, lld, hld.
Solve LLD questions on your own, after some practice you'll be able to come with better designs on your own.
HLD is just about theory, which component should be integrated to help your system.
First create a note for all these components, for e.g-

sharding - concept and where to use
queues - concept and where to use...
db designs and api calls also plays an imp part in designing. Again, to come up with everything in 1 hr interview is really difficult. But more preperation will only increase your luck factor.
