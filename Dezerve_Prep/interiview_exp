Round 2 Coding round


You are given a triangular array/list 'TRIANGLE'. Your task is to return the minimum path sum to reach from the top to the bottom row.


The triangle array will have N rows and the i-th row, where 0 <= i < N will have i + 1 elements.


You can move only to the adjacent number of rows below each step. For example, if you are at index j in row i, then you can move to j or j + 1 index in row i + 1 in each step.


If the array given is 'TRIANGLE' = [[1], [2,3], [3,6,7], [8,9,6,1]] the triangle array will look like:


1


2,3


3,6,7


8,9,6,10


For the given triangle array the minimum sum path would be 1->2->3->8. Hence the answer would be 14.


Round 3 LLD
Mandate Problem


Mandates act as tokens for standing instructions with bank. It will enable the merchant to debit money from customer’s bank account. Standing instructions based on credit card are facilitated by VISA/Master/Rupay/Amex networks. NPCI facilitates internet banking based standing instructions - which is linked with customer bank account. There are different payment gateways which works as a middleman to integrate with NPCI. We can use mandate to make a debit from customer’s account for making investments, both lumpsum and sips. Prepare the LLD to integrate with a payment gateway to setup mandate and use the same in different flows.
