-normalisation in sql, abstract vs interface, static keyword, and a new question every 2mins


real purpose of LLD round - the design question (time left : 40mins)


Q1 Design a call center


Requirement understanding


Constraints and assumptions


What levels of employees are in the call center?
Operator, supervisor, director
Can we assume operators always get the initial calls?
Yes - Algo to decide operator -> supervisor -> director
If there are no available operators or the operator can't handle the call, does the call go to the supervisors?
Yes
If there is no available supervisors or the supervisor can't handle the call, does the call go to the directors?
Yes
Can we assume the directors can handle all calls?
Yes


What happens if nobody can answer the call?
It gets queued


Do we need to handle 'VIP' calls where we put someone to the front of the line?
No


Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
Assume they're valid


System Requirements Clarification
: i.e who will interact with the system and how will this
Entity Design
Actual implementation of one of the developed feature


Thoughts:
Comp : 20fixed (max for SDE-2 band)
5days/week from office
majority work in python
interviewer was more of a showoff than actual knowledgeable guy
was left stranded once encoutered a plethora of questions in LLD round apart from the LLD question itself
requirements from the LLD also were not clear and later on was asked to complete it in 45 mins with all Design principles in mind
########
skeptical about the culture as well, if such is the interview being conducted by an exact team engineer in such an unorganised manner


------------------------------------------------------------



Status : 2-2.5 YOE
Position : SDE-1 [product based MNC]


Round 1 : Problem Solving and DSA


It was done by a third party organization. Interviewer asked two problems.


Some problem based on Matrix (standard problem)
Return the number of ways, the given integer can be written as sum of consecutive integers.
Ex : 15 can be written is 3 ways [15, 7+8, 4+5+6]
Round 2 : LLD


Interviewer asked to design Car Rental System.


Round 3 : CTO Round


Current project discussion and few cross questions along with some behavioural questions.


After second round, HR mentioned that in LLD Round, feedback is positive but expectations was little more.
After final Round, HR mentioned the same thing again.


Hope it helps. Please upvote

Applied online, gave my first round of interview. Which was DS And Algo. I cleared that without any hiccup. Now 2nd round was Low Level Design Round. Gave him an overview of classes and use cases. The interviewer was very rude and impolite. (When conversation was about to end). He said no design is perfect, and this cannot be wrong or right. And he rejected me in that round. A terrible experience overall.

Interview

The interview process was good, and HR told me I am selected and they will give me the offer letter in 2-3 days. But I didn't receive any update from their side. Then I called him and he kept saying yes you are selected and I will give you offer letter in 2-3 days. After 15 days he told me we are not hiring and all the positions are filled. Feedback tell the candidate clearly do not hold them for 2-3 weeks. Worst HR experience in my journey.
