## 30. LinkedIn Mutual Connection Search

### Overview  
- **Problem:** Quickly compute mutual connections in a large social graph.  
- **Primary Goal:** Efficient graph traversal and query performance for millions of users.

### Architecture & Components  
- **Graph Database:**  
  - Use Neo4j or other specialized graph databases.  
- **Indexing:**  
  - Build indexes for user nodes and their connections.
- **API Layer:**  
  - Expose REST endpoints for search queries.

### Detailed Approach  
- **Precomputation:**  
  - Periodically calculate and cache popular mutual connection queries.  
- **Query Optimization:**  
  - Utilize graph traversal algorithms optimized for sparse or dense graphs.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Partition the social graph by user segments and cache frequently accessed results.

### Challenges & Mitigation  
- **Query Latency:** Use in-memory caches and efficient indexing to reduce lookup times.  
- **Data Volume:** Partition and distribute the graph database to handle large user bases.

## 31. Distributed Priority Queue

### Overview  
- **Problem:** Manage a distributed, ordered task queue with priority handling.  
- **Primary Goal:** Guarantee ordering and efficient retrieval in a fault-tolerant environment.

### Architecture & Components  
- **Data Store:**  
  - Use Redis sorted sets or a distributed messaging system (like Kafka) with priority extensions.
- **API Layer:**  
  - Expose enqueue and dequeue endpoints.
- **Consensus Protocols:**  
  - Implement distributed consensus (e.g., via ZooKeeper) to ensure ordering.

### Detailed Approach  
- **Priority Handling:**  
  - Use sorted sets keyed on priority scores for fast insertions and lookups.  
- **Distributed Consistency:**  
  - Leverage consensus algorithms to synchronize queue state across nodes.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Partition queues by priority ranges and replicate data for redundancy.

### Challenges & Mitigation  
- **Strict Ordering:** Use distributed locking or consensus to prevent reordering.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Build in retry mechanisms and redundant backups to maintain queue integrity.
